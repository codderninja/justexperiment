    My Love, My Sweetheart.
So many things to say and do,
Wishing I could hold you.
Many moments we’ve shared,
The perfect couple, so I’ve heard.

My Love, My Sweetheart.
The world is yours and mine,
Frozen together in a distant time.
I would run mile after mile,
To just see you and that gorgeous smile.

My Valentine, My Sweetheart.
My hearts is only for you,
Feeling like a dream come true.
You’re like an angel from above,
And I present you with all my love.
